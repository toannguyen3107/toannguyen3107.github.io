## About Me

Welcome to my blog! Iâ€™m a computer science student from Vietnam with a passion for coding, learning new technologies, and exploring cybersecurity. Here, I share my journey, projects, and insights as I navigate through the world of computer science and delve into cyberattack and penetration testing strategies.

## My Journey

I study Computer Science at my university (Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology). Because I am excited about cybersecurity, especially penetration testing, I started learning it through TryHackMe and Coursera when I was a first-year student and obtained a few certificates. Recently, I have been using Hack The Box, where I have tackled many machines and challenges. I want to create a blog to document my solutions when I solve CTFs or labs.

## What I Write About

On this blog, you will find posts on:
- **Coding Tutorials:** Step-by-step guides and tutorials on various programming languages and tools.
- **Projects:** Detailed write-ups on my personal and academic projects.
- **Tech Insights:** My thoughts and analyses on current trends and topics in technology.
- **Cybersecurity:** In-depth articles on cyberattack techniques, penetration testing strategies, and how to defend against threats. Solutions hackthebox, CTFs and labs.
- **Learning Tips:** Tips and resources for learning programming, improving your coding skills, and understanding cybersecurity concepts.

## My Goals
